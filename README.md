# MEME THE DREAM
## What your project is/does (and what it's called)
Meme the Dream is a browser game that turns boredom while waiting in line into a fun, active challenge. Players match meme poses using their webcam. You play as Kyle, a high schooler battling raccoons with perfectly timed meme poses across three levels of increasing difficulty.

## Why you made your project
We made it during the JPEG hackathon in July 2025. We tested our creativity, coding and art skills! It was lots of fun and tried to make coding rewarding for all.

## How you made your project
We created a full stack web application with the following tools and art drawn by our artist.

Libraries:
- mediapipe (for computer vision)
- open cv

Languages:
- html, js, css (frontend)
- python (backend)
- Flask API (full stack)
  
## What you struggled with and what you learned
We struggled with integrating flask API to connect our front end and backend. Due to the 24 hour time deadline it was difficult to finish everything in time but with a solid plan we learned how to complete it!
